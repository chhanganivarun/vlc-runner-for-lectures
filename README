This is a vlc list generator and lets you continuously play through all the
lectures of a course without needing to exit vlc and play each file again and
again.

To run to program first generate a file list using make_file_list.sh. This
will generate a file called file_list. Then run program startfrom.py. This
program accepts video number to start from as optional. This program accesses
file_list.py and plays videos from there by making a call to terminal using
library subrocess.
